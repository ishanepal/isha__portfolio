                    I'm currently a senior at Northern Kentucky University, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. My academic journey 
                    has been driven by a passion for problem-solving and a deep interest in the intersection of artificial intelligence, 
                    and human behavior.

                    I'm actively engaged in research focused on developing a Security-Oriented Awareness and Training Framework that leverages User and Entity 
                    Behavior Analytics (UEBA), Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance cybersecurity awareness. I have the privilege 
                    of working under the guidance of Dr. Rasib Khan at the School of Computing and Analytics, contributing to the design of a unified model that 
                    aims to reshape how organizations approach security training and behavior-based threat detection.

                    In addition to my research, I serve as a Teaching Assistant for the Theory of Computation course, mentored by Dr. Gary Newell. This role has 
                    strengthened my foundational understanding of formal systems and algorithms, while also allowing me to support fellow students in navigating 
                    complex theoretical concepts.

                    Beyond the classroom and lab, I'm a curious learner and avid reader who enjoys exploring a wide range of topics. I unwind by watching 
                    movies and series, and I strive to maintain a balanced lifestyle through regular physical activity.
